To use these demonstrators, you will need to have install `docker` and `docker-compose`.

The examples covers the following topics:

* The process of adding an organisation to an existing network channel;
* Using Kafka to create a crash resistence network;
* Creating networks with private data;
* Create and orchestrate a simple two organisations network that you can use to help you debug chaincodes.
