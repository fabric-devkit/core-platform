# Overview

This is a Fabric Devkit [sub-project](https://github.com/fabric-devkit/core-platform) intended to help platform engineers, DevOps engineers or Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) appreciate the process of instantiating and orchestrating a Hyperledger Fabric network.

## Prequisite

You will need to have a conceptual understanding of Hyperledger Fabric blockchain. If you new to the concept of blockchain, please refer to the [Hyperledger Fabric's official documentation](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/blockchain.html) to familiarise yourself with key concepts.

## What can I expect of this project

In this project you will find demonstrators covering aspects of Hyperledger Fabric components you would orchestrate a functioning Hyperledger Fabric network. In this project, you will see experiments demonstrating ways to:

* Generate bootstrapping cryptographic materials and genesis block
* Create a basic network to support your development work
* Add an organisation to a channel in an network
* Create a private data network
* Create a Kafka based network
* Create a Raft based network 

## How to use this project

1. Clone this project `git clone https://github.com/fabric-devkit/core-platform`.

2. Choose the topics you wish to learn (see links on the left panel).
